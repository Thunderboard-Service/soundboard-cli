# Soundboard CLI

This program will serve as a cli to interact with the soundboard discord bot.
There are 5 main commands:

- `soundboard-cli config token <token>`: This command will allow you to set the access token generated by the bot.
- `soundboard-cli config api <api-url>`: This command will allow you to set the url of the api.
- `soundboard-cli list`: This command will list all the sound clips available to play.
- `soundboard-cli play <sound-id>`: This command will play the sound clip of your choice.
- `soundboard-cli add <sound-name> <sound-file>`: This command will upload a sound clip to the bot.

## Building
You need rust and cargo. Easily installed via `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
Then you only need to run `cargo build --release` and the binary will be available at `target/release/soundboard-cli`

## Installation
Copy the file `target/release/soundboard-cli` to a directory in your PATH. For example: `cp target/release/soundboard-cli /usr/local/bin/soundboard-cli`
Get a token provided to you by the hoster of the bot and run `soundboard-cli token <token>`
Get the url of the api and run `soundboard-cli api https://api.example.com/`
You are now ready to use the cli.

## Usage
Run `soundboard-cli list` to list all the sound clips available to play.
Run `soundboard-cli play <sound-id>` to play the sound clip of your choice.
Run `soundboard-cli add <sound-name> <sound-file>` to upload a sound clip to the bot.
For all of these commands you will need to have set the token and the api url.
